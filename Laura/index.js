// // **Basic Arithmetic Problems**

// Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold?
let priceTotal = 6450;
let priceTicket = 15;
console.log(priceTotal / priceTicket); // 430

// Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?
let weekIncome = 500;
let weeksPerMonth = 4;
let monthsPerYear = 12;
console.log(weekIncome * weeksPerMonth * monthsPerYear); // 24000

// **Percentage**

// Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: number%
let x = 17;
let y = 30;
let total = 100;
console.log((x / y) * total);

// **Geometry Formulas**

// Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.
let side = 4.75;
let numberSides = 4;
console.log(side * numberSides); // 19

// Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.
let side1 = 5;
let side2 = 6;
let side3 = 7;
console.log(side1 + side2 + side3); //18

// Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.
let sideSquare = 5;
console.log(sideSquare * sideSquare); // 25

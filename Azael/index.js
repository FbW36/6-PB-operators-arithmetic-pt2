// ### Basic Arithmetic Problems

// Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold?
let total = 6450;
let singleTicket = 15;

let totalTickets = total / singleTicket;

console.log("total tickets sold==>" + totalTickets + " " + "dollars");

// Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?

let incomeWeekly = 500;
let weeksYear = 12 * 4;

let incomeYear = incomeWeekly * weeksYear;

console.log("total income/year==>" + incomeYear + " " + "dollars");

// ### Percentage

// Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: number%

let percentage = (17 / 30) * 100;

console.log("percentage==>" + percentage + "%");

// ### Geometry Formulas

// Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.

let side = 4.75;

let perimeter = side * 4;

console.log("perimeter ==>" + perimeter + " " + "cm");

// Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.

let l1 = 5;
let l2 = 6;
let l3 = 7;

let perimeter1 = l1 + l2 + l3;
console.log("perimeter1 ==>" + perimeter1 + " " + "cm");
// Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.

let side1 = 5;

let areaSquare = side1 * side1;

console.log("areaSquare ==>" + areaSquare + " " + "cm2");

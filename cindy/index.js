//Basic Arithmetic Problems

//Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold?
let dollars = 6450;
let ticket = 15;
let result = dollars / ticket;
console.log(result + " tickets were sold");

//Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?
let incomeWeek = 500;
let weeks = 32;
let result2 = incomeWeek * weeks;
console.log(result2 + " is what Sylvia makes every year");

//Percentage;

//Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: number%
let randNum = 17;
let randPct = randNum / 32;
console.log(randPct * 100 + "%");

//Geometry Formulas

//Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.
let side = 4.75;
console.log(side * 4 + "cms");

//Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.
let p1 = 5;
let p2 = 6;
let p3 = 7;
console.log(p1 + p2 + p3 + "cms");
//Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.
let s1 = 5;
console.log(s1 ** 2);
let one = Math.pow(s1, 2);
console.log(one);

//Basic Arithmetic Problems

// Q1.In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars.Each ticket costs 15 dollars.How many tickets were sold ?

let sum = 6450;
let ticket = 15;

console.log("This amount of tickets was sold:", sum / ticket);

//Q2.Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?

let inc = 500;

console.log("Silvia has a yearly income of:", inc * 52);

//Percentage

// Q3.Calculate the percentage of 17 / 30. Expected output: number %

let w = 17;
let g = 30;

console.log((w / g) * 100, "%");

//Geometry Formulas

//Q4.Calculate the perimeter of a square.Assume each side is 4.75cm. U=a+b+c+d

let side = 4.75;

console.log("The perimeter of the square is ", side + side + side + side);

//Q5.Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.

let a = 5;
let b = 6;
let c = 7;

console.log("The perimeter of the triangle is ", a + b + c);

//Q6.Calculate the area of a square.Each side is 5cm.
let d = 5;

console.log("The area are:", 5 * 5, "square cm's");
